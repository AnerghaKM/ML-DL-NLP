# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing, a component of data preparation, describes any type of processing performed on raw data to prepare it for another data processing procedure. It has traditionally been an important preliminary step for the data mining process.

There are several different tools and methods used for preprocessing data, including the following:

   ~ sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data.  
        
   ~ transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input.  
    
   ~ denoising, which removes noise from data.  
    
   ~ imputation, which synthesizes statistically relevant data for missing values.  
    
   ~ normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access.  
    
   ~ feature extraction, which pulls out a relevant feature subset that is significant in a particular context.
